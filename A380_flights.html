        <p class="blog-text">I have always been fascinated by commercial aeroplanes. So for my first data project where better to start
        than with one of the largest aircraft in the sky; the Airbus A380. I want to answer a few simple questions, where does it fly? 
        how frequently? and where can you see the most A380 departures and arrivals in a single 3-hr time window? Lets find out.....
        
        <H3 class="blog-head-text">How many airports does the A380 fly to?</H3>
        <p class="blog-text">As of July 2016 the A380 was operating out of 54 different airports.</p>
        
        <H3 class="blog-head-text">Which airports have the most daily A380 departures?</H3>
        <p class="blog-text">The airport with the most daily A380 flights is Dubai with 72 daily departures. Dubai is the home hub airport of Emirates Airlines, which 
        has the largest A380 fleet in the world. Second on the list is London Heathrow with 26 daily departures, followed by 
        Singapore Changi (20) and Paris Charles de Gaulle (18). In North America, LAX has the highest number of daily A380 
        depatures with 13.The figure below shows airports with four or more daily A380 departures.  </p>

      <H3 class="blog-head-text">Which airports have the most daily A380 departures in a given 3hr time window?</H3>
        <p class="blog-text">For any budding plane spotters out there like myself.... if you want to see the most A380 
        depatures in a 3 hour interval, you should head to Dubai between 6 and 9am when there are 17 scheduled A380 departures.
        If you can hang around for another 3 hours, you can expect to see a further 16 depatures. Dubai International holds
        the top five positions, followed by Singapore Changi between 9-12pm (8), Paris CDG between 12-3pm (7) and London Heathrow
        between 12-3pm (6). </p>

        <p class="blog-text">If arrivals are more your thing then you should head to Dubai between 3 and 6am or between 
        6 and 9am when there are 16 scheduled A380 arrivals. Dubai holds the top five positions again, followed by 
        CDG (6-9am), LHR (3-6am), LHR (12-3pm) and SIN (6-9am) which all share 6 arrivals in each time window. </p>
